      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>My name is Vanbavinckhove Franky i am a retierd seaman from Belgium, I started as an able body seaman for a couple of years, in the biggest dredging company of the world JDN, and later worked my way up to become first mate.
      Allthough i have a certificate for captain, i was never able to fulfill this task for my company.
      At the age of 60, i said after more than 35 years of faithful service Goodbye, and left to enjoy my well earned pension.One of my hobbies is trying to learn Python among other things. My favorite occupation is watching a good game of footbal
      with a nice chilled pint of beer and a good piece of good cheese.</p>
